# AUT-VEC-S4 Project mainpage
Welcome to the default/starting repository for the AUT-VEC-S4 project. Every project group should fork from this repository to begin their project. Inside every sub-folder a readme file elaborates on the file structure. This file can be edited by using the GitHub editer or any basic text editor (notepad++ or Atom is adviced). This allows for group specific comments on the added documents.

### Basic rules
- There is no such thing as too small commits. However make them usefull and preferably working.
- Always comment IN your files on your intent, this holds for MATLAB and simulink files.
- Commits are always commented .
- Take care of your repository make keep it clean and readable .
  - Use subfolders only when necessary.
  - Testing can be done by branching instead of renaming files.
  - Tag your important commits (e.g. V1.0 intermediate challange).
- Choose refering over copying.
- First pull before working on the project.
